# [DEPRECATED] Add Term Button to Top

This feature moves the add term button to the top of the page. This makes it easier to access rather than needing to scroll to the bottom of a potentially long list.

_DEPRECATED_
Instructure moved the add term button to the top of the page when they updated it to use pagination. This feature is no longer needed, but still remains for users that may be using a self-hosted version that hasn't received this update yet.
