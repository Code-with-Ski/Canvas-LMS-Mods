# Enhance Search Results

This feature makes improvements to the data in the rows for the course search results. It adds the course code below the course name. It adds quick links to the People page and gradebook for a course.  It adds a locked icon for concluded courses. It adds a link to the sub-account if the admin has admin access to that sub-account.
