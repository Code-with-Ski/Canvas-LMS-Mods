# Import Rubric

This feature allows a user to import the rubric details when adding/editing a rubric.  The user will need to follow the proper format and can use the sample file as a reference point.  They will need to enter/paste the data in the import dialog with the column values separated by a tab.  When the data is formatted properly it will load the details into the edit rubric preview.  This allows the user to review the imported data and how it was added to the rubric before creating the rubric.  This also allows the user to add additional criteria and/or import outcomes.

There are two import options:
- Import: This will keep any exisiting criteria in the rubric and add new rows to the end for the new criteria that are imported.
- Import and Replace: This will remove any existing criteria from the rubric and add rows for the new criteria that are imported.

This feature also adds an export criteria button next to the "Import Details" button.  This will allow the user to export the current criteria in the edit view to a tab separated values file that is in the proper format for importing data.  This is useful if a user has a rubric started already and is looking to add more criteria and wants to organize the rubric order all at once, especially when working with outcomes.  It can also be used to allow the user to get the data from one rubric to use as a starting template for a new rubric and/or to 'make a copy'.
