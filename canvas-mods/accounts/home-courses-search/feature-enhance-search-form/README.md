# Enhance Search Form

This feature improves the search form for the courses. This fills the extra space after the blueprint button to avoid the extra blank space being treated as part of the button. This also adds options to search by published state and to sort by the Canvas course ID.  Sorting by the Canvas course ID can help with finding the most recently created courses.
