# Expand Accounts

This feature adds an expand all checkbox that will expand all the sub-accounts to reduce the number of clicks to access nested sub-accounts. This also helps to load in all sub-accounts for the search accounts feature.

The browser extension options also allow you to control if they should all be expanded by default on page load. The option to collapse sub-accounts is hidden while the expand all option is checked.
